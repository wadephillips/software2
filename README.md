#Acme Calendar
The **Acme Calendar** has three main sections, Calendars, Customers, and Reports.  Each has its own button at the top of the application window.


## Calendars


## Customers 

The customers section of the application displays a TableView containing all _active_ customers when first loaded.

There are two buttons above the Table View, one for adding a new customer and one to edit an existing customer.
The _addCustomerButton_ is always enabled.  However, the editCustomerButton is disabled until a customer row is clicked in the TableView.


## Reports
There are 3 reports available in the reports section.
Each report has its own button on the left hand side of the screen.  Clicking on the reports button will load the report.
